== INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ==

Download all these files to a separate location.


---- INSTALLING FORGE ----

Open your Minecraft Launcher.
Select new Profile.
Name this profile MC1710.
Under version, select "release 1.7.10"
Start the game to download Minecraft 1.7.10.
Once Minecraft loads, exit Minecraft.

Right-click forge-1.7.10-10.13.3.1408-1.17.10-installer.jar
Select "Open With --> Java(TM) Platform SE binary"
It will take a moment to open the installer.
Select "Install Client"
The installer will prompt you when the install is complete.

Open the Minecraft launcher.  Select the profile "Forge."
Select "Edit Profile."
Rename profile to "Forge1710"
Check Game Directory.
At the end of the list you will see ".minecraft"
Change ".minecraft" to ".forge1710"

Check JVM Arguments.  Delete the entire line.
Add -Xmx3G (Replace 3 with your desired GB of RAM to use).
(I suggest a minimum of 3GB and if possible 6-8GB of RAM).

Save the profile.
Start Minecraft.
Forge loader will begin initial setup for mods, give it time.
After Minecraft starts, exit Minecraft.
Forge setup complete, continue to installing mods.

---- INSTALLING THE MODS ----

Open your start menu or and insert "%appdata%"
Look for the directory .forge1710
Open .forge1710
Copy the config and mods folders from where you downloaded to .forge1710
Allow it to overwrite both the mods and config folderes.
Mod installation complete, you now have everything needed.

WARNING: 
Upon restarting Minecraft, it will take awhile the first
time to load. Strongly suggest you examine your options as they
will be vastly expanded. If you create a single player world, 
ensure you select advanced options and use Biomes'O Plenty for
full effect of mod pack upon Survival mode.

Enjoy and have fun!  These instructions may look complicated,
but they really are quite simple.  Contact me if you have any
troubles.
