---- UPDATING THE MOD PACK ----

WARNING: REMEMBER TO ALWAYS DELETE THE OLD VERSIONS OF MODS.
		OTHERWISE YOU WILL HAVE CONFLICTING ISSUES/CRASHES.
		YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

Client Side (Full Wipe):
1) Ensure the server is running the newer version.
2) WinXP: Start --> Run --> %appdata% // Win7: Type %appdata% into "Search programs and files"
3) This is your roaming directory, go to where you told Forge to have it's MC Folder.
	(If you followed my directions it's Roaming/.forge1710)
4) Delete the directories mods and config
5) Download the mods and config folders again.

Client Side (Selective Update)
1) Ensure the server is running the newer version.
2) See changelog.txt and read the changes.
3) Update the specific mods listed.
4) Update the specific config files listed.

Server Side Updates:
Same as above, but I suggest you follow the Client Side (Selective Update)
as this will allow you to update the key files with less hassle on upload times.

"Help, I didn't ensure the server was running the new update."
You'll have to hunt down the mods that got updated in the changelog.txt and
download their last versions PRIOR to the ones listed in the update.

Example:
Pack updated to Hardcore Ender Expansion 1.8.1 but the server isn't updated.
You need to download Hardcore Ender Expansion 1.8.0 for Minecraft Forge 1.7.10 from their website.
