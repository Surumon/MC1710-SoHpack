WARNING: 
Upon restarting Minecraft, it will take awhile the first
time to load. Strongly suggest you examine your options as they
will be vastly expanded. If you create a single player world, 
ensure you select advanced options and use Biomes'O Plenty for
full effect of mod pack upon Survival mode.

Enjoy and have fun!  These instructions may look complicated,
but they really are quite simple.  Contact me if you have any
troubles.
